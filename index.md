I'm a Physics Master's student at the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich. I am originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India.
I love anything and everything related to astrophysics and fluids! My current research interests lie in astrophysical fluid dynamics, more specifically in magnetohydrodynamic turbulence.
You can also find me posting what I'd like to call humourous content in the social media handle [Punpaadu] (https://www.instagram.com/punpaadu/Punpaadu). You can find puns/memes/jokes in Tamil (a south Indian language) and English.

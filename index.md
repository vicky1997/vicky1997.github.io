I'm a Physics Master's student at the Ludwig-Maximilians University, Munich. I am originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India.
I love anything and everything related to astrophysics and fluids! My current research interests lie in astrophysical turbulence and in planet formation. I like to work on simulations and theory. But I am open to working on observations too!
You can also find me posting what I'd like to call humorous content in the social media handle [Punpaadu](https://www.instagram.com/punpaadu/). You can find puns/memes/jokes in Tamil (a south Indian language) and English.

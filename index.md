I'm a PhD student at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research, Goettingen. I am originally from Chennai, a coastal city in South India.
I love anything and everything related to astrophysics and fluids! My current research interests lie in planet formation and dust evolution. I work on Monte Carlo methods for dust evolution leading to planet formation.

I thrive with multiple hobbies and mostly I spend my free time playing music. I play the violin and dabble with a few other instruments.
I like to collaborate with other musicians and as a result here are a few such instances :

I also got the opportunity to give a lecture demonstration on Carnatic Music - South Indian Classical Music, to the members of the Munich International orchestra.

I thrive with multiple hobbies and mostly I spend my free time playing music. I play the violin and dabble with a few other instruments.
I like to collaborate with other musicians and as a result here are a few such instances :

I also got the opportunity to give a lecture demonstration on Carnatic Music - South Indian Classical Music, to the members of the Munich International orchestra.

You can also find me posting what I'd like to call humorous content in the social media handle [Punpaadu](https://www.instagram.com/punpaadu/). You can find puns/memes/jokes in Tamil (a south Indian language) and English.

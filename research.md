I try to understand, learn and unlearn many things related to but not restricted to computational Astrophysics. I right now am interested in working in topics related to Star and Planet Formation, Fluid Dynamics and Radiative transfer processes. Topics like Turbulence and Dust Dynamics excite me!! 

Projects:

Carbon Desctruction in Protoplanetary disks :
May 2021 - Present
The destruction processes of Car

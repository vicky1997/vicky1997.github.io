I try to understand, learn and unlearn many things related to but not restricted to computational Astrophysics. I right now am interested in working in topics related to Star and Planet Formation, Fluid Dynamics and Radiative transfer processes. Topics like Turbulence and Dust Dynamics excite me!! 

Projects:

Carbon Destruction in Protoplanetary disks :

The destruction processes of carbonaceous grains in planet forming disks is still a very open ended question. Using 1-Dimensional Monte Carlo Models of dust coagulation, we are looking at photolysis or the destruction of carbon by UV photons.

Topology and Stochasticity of Turbulent Magnetic Fields :

One of the topics where " What about magnetic fields? " is a question that cannot be asked in any seminar. Magnetohydrodynamic turbulence has a wealth of topics at almost all scales in astrophysics. I worked in looking at Magnetic Reconnection and Richardson Diffusion for a simulation and looking at diagnostics for reconnection events.


Study of Binary Star Cluser IC848 :
My first project in astronomy, and I worked on a photometric study of the Heart and Soul Nebula! Using data from surveys like NEWFIRM, 2MASS etc we resolved the star cluster based on the binary star system in the region. 



I have been fortunate to have been a part of a few projects which have turned into publications.
